# 🌟 Yarlin Lynn’s Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my custom-built portfolio site! This is a handcrafted, responsive, and fun digital home where I showcase my web development skills, favorite projects, and professional journey.

## 🎯 What Makes It Special

- ✅ Built 100% from scratch—no templates, no themes, pure handcrafted HTML, CSS, and a splash of JavaScript.
- 🌈 Designed to be engaging and professional with a touch of playfulness.
- 📱 Fully responsive: looks awesome on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- 💡 Ideal for showing off your work, résumé, and creative vibe!

## 🧩 Getting Started

Want to tinker or use it yourself?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yarlinlynn/Portfolio.git
cd Portfolio
open index.html  # or double-click it
```
> Voilà—your portfolio is live locally.

<br/>

## 💻 How It Works

The portfolio is made up of:

- `index.html` – Core structure of the website
- `style.css` – All visual styling, layout, typography, and responsiveness
- `script.js` – Optional JavaScript for interactivity
- SVG icons and graphics embedded in the HTML or linked externally

> The SVG animations use `@keyframes`, transitions, and stroke-dash techniques to bring certain graphics to life — subtly but effectively.

## ✍️ How to Customize It
- Projects: Edit the HTML in the projects section—swap in your images, descriptions, links.
- About & Skills: Update text and adjust the layout as needed.
- Colors & Fonts: Tweak the style.css or add your favorite fonts and palette.
- Interactions: If you want animations or interactivity, drop in your own JavaScript or CSS transitions.
